							<br>
							<p>Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Heaven Campbell, a passionate Data Analyst with a knack for transforming complex data into actionable insights. With a strong background in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI, I specialize in uncovering trends, generating reports, and driving data-driven decision-making.</p>
								<h3>My Journey</h3>
								<p>My journey into data analysis began with a curiosity about how data can reveal stories and drive strategic decisions. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the University of North Texas at Dallas,
								 which provided me with a solid foundation in quantitative analysis and problem-solving. Building on that knowledge, I pursued a master’s degree in Informatics - Data Science/Data Analytics from Texas Woman's University, where I deepened my expertise and developed advanced analytical skills. Over the years, 
								 I’ve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, from analyzing market trends to optimizing operational efficiencies.</p>
								<h3>My Approach</h3>
								<p>I believe that data analysis is more than just numbers—it's about telling a story that drives action. My approach involves understanding the core business questions, analyzing data to uncover hidden patterns, and presenting findings in a way that’s both informative and compelling. Whether it’s through interactive dashboards or detailed reports, I strive to make data an integral part of the decision-making process.</p>
								<h3>Let's Connect</h3>
								<p>I'm always eager to discuss new opportunities and collaborate on exciting projects. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect, explore potential collaborations, or just chat about the latest trends in data analytics.</p>
								<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio!</p>

							<h2 class="major">Police Incidents EDA</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/policeimage (1).jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this project, I performed a comprehensive statistical and exploratory analysis of Dallas Police Incidents data from 2023 using Python and SQL. The goal was to uncover patterns and trends in police activity to inform public safety strategies and improve police-community relations. The analysis involved data cleaning, statistical exploration, and the creation of visualizations such as histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots to understand the distribution of incidents, demographic factors, and spatial trends.</p>
							<p>Overall this project demonstrated my ability to leverage Python and SQL to deliver actionable insights from large datasets, showcasing data storytelling skills and a strong understanding of public safety data.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Insurance Claims Analysis </h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/insuranceimage (1).jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this project, I performed a statistical and exploratory analysis of an insurance claim prediction dataset using Python. The goal was to uncover patterns and trends that influence insurance claim likelihood, focusing on key factors such as age, gender, and region. The analysis included data cleaning, exploratory data visualizations like histograms, box plots, and machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, to predict the likelihood of claims.</p>
							<p>This project showcased my skills in machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights into risk management and customer segmentation. By integrating community detection algorithms, the analysis also uncovered distinct groups of policyholders, revealing deeper insights into claim behaviors and potential risk factors.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Kinder Place Analysis </h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/kinderimage.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this project, I designed and implemented a comprehensive database schema in MySQL for a kindergarten management system. The task involved creating an efficient schema to manage various aspects of kindergarten operations, including student records, parent information, health records, and financial data. I performed advanced SQL operations such as JOINs, subqueries, and UNIONs for effective data analysis and integration.</p> 
							<p>Additionally, I developed SQL views and stored procedures to automate reporting and data aggregation processes, streamlining operations and improving accuracy. Data transformation techniques were applied to clean and filter data, ensuring its integrity and completeness for reliable reporting and decision-making. This project highlighted my ability to create a scalable and efficient database system, demonstrating my proficiency in SQL and data management.</p>
